`z0` _Web Dev Snippets_
=======================

`z0` is a loose collection of ultra-minimal web development snippets, designed 
to be pasted into the `<HEAD>` of a web page or web app. 

By using [code-golf techniques](http://goo.gl/uoJF5t), `z0` snippets are able to
pack a surprising amount of functionality into a few lines of code.
